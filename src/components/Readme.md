The components folder, located at the root of the React app, is intended to contain only Dumb Components. These components are designed to be controlled and reusable, making them suitable for implementing common UI elements such as buttons, inputs, and more.

By keeping these components separate from other logic-heavy components, you can ensure that they remain focused on presentation and user interaction. This promotes reusability and maintainability throughout your application.
