This is the features folder that will contain most of the logic for each feature. Each feature will be placed in its own folder. For example, let's take the authentication feature. We will have an "auth" folder that will contain a "login" folder and a "register" folder. These will be rendered in the corresponding pages, such as "Login.ts" and "Register.ts".

For each feature, like "auth", we will also have a "components" folder that will contain only the components used in that feature.
