The providers folder is where Higher-Order Components (HOCs) for layout, context, or Redux are placed. HOCs are used to enhance the functionality of components by providing them with additional props or behavior. In this folder, you can find HOCs that are responsible for managing the layout of components, providing context to components, or connecting components to the Redux store. These HOCs play a crucial role in managing the state and behavior of components throughout the application.
