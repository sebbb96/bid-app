# Pages

This folder contains the different pages of the React app. Each page represents a separate view or route in the application.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure within the Pages folder follows the component hierarchy of the app's DOM tree. Each page component is organized in its own subfolder, with any related components, styles, or assets stored within that subfolder.

Only the page component that will render the children should be placed directly in this folder.
